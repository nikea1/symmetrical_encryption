# Simple Encrytion Program

A simple program that encrypts text files using symmetric keys. It's not meant to be used for actual projects that requires encryption as the keys are 4-bits long. In other words a value between 8 and 15 inclusive. This project was just ment to further understand the process of Encryption with symmetric keys. This algorithm came from the example given from a Wikipedia article about Symmetric Key Algorithms.

## Getting Started

Download the main file and access it though your terminal of choice.

To run the program set mode to 'encode' or 'decode', the file you want to process, and the key value

````
./executable encode file.txt 8
````

### Prerequisites

At minimum you need a terminal to run the program.

MacOS comes with a Unix terminal.

For Windows users download Cygwin a unix like terminal from cygwin.org or your terminal of choice. You can also download CodeBlocks IDE to run the program.
